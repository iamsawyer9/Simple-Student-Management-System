"# Simple-Student-Management-System" 

In this project, I developed a Student Management System designed to streamline the process of managing student records, courses, enrollments, and grades. My goal was to create a user-friendly application that could facilitate the administrative tasks associated with educational management.

To achieve this, I utilized Python for the core programming logic, leveraging its simplicity and power to handle the application's backend processes. For the database management, I employed MySQL, designing a schema and implementing CRUD operations to store and manipulate the data efficiently. The graphical user interface (GUI) was built using Tkinter, allowing me to craft an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system easily.

Throughout this project, I integrated these technologies seamlessly, focusing on creating a functional and coherent application. Alongside the development, I honed my problem-solving skills by navigating through various challenges, from debugging to feature implementation, ensuring the project met its requirements.
